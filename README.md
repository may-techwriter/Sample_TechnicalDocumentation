# Technical Writing Portfolio ‚Äì Mayra

Welcome to my portfolio as a Technical Writer!

This repository showcases sample documentation for the biometric web service called **FaceRecognition**, including API references, configuration guides, release notes, and validation workflows. It reflects a docs-as-code approach using Markdown, YAML, and OpenAPI, designed for developer clarity and modular reuse.

---

## Web Service Overview

**FaceRecognition** enables secure identity registration and facial recognition-based identification. It supports the full identity lifecycle‚Äîincluding Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, allowing users to manage biometric records stored in relational databases such as PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server. Once enrolled, individuals can be identified through facial recognition endpoints designed for high-accuracy matching.

## About Me

I'm a bilingual Technical Writer (English/Spanish) focused on strategic documentation for engineering teams. I specialize in translating complex technical decisions into clear, actionable content using tools like Markdown, YAML, OpenAPI, and Git-based workflows. My work emphasizes clarity, ethical documentation, and developer-first usability.

## What's Included

This repository features:

- **API references** defined in `FaceRecognition_RESTAPI.yaml`, organized under `API_Documentation/`
- **Configuration guide** to customize system behavior (`Configuration/Configuration_Guide_v10.1.1.md`)
- **Release notes** with impact analysis across software versions (`Release_notes/Release_notes_v10.1.1.md`)
- **Validation examples** using Postman and cURL (`Validation/`)
- **Workflow diagrams** and logic flows (`Diagrams/`)
- **Documentation standards** for error handling, naming conventions, and versioning (`Standards/`)

## API Visualization

You can explore the OpenAPI spec interactively using [Redoc](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/may-techwriter/Sample_TechnicalDocumentation/main/FaceRecognition_v10.1.1.yaml)

This visualization is for documentation purposes only. The API is not connected to a live backend service.

---

## Validation Methods

- ‚úÖ Postman collections for biometric identification endpoints  
- ‚úÖ cURL examples for enrolment and verification  
- ‚ùå Swagger UI not used due to spec limitations and lack of backend connectivity

---

## Tools & Methods

- Markdown, YAML, OpenAPI  
- Postman, cURL for endpoint validation  
- Git-based docs-as-code workflows  
- Redoc for static API visualization

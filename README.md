# Technical Writing Portfolio – Mayra

¡Welcome to my portfolio as a Technical Writer!

This space showcases documentation I have created for biometric web services, including API consumption, configuration guides, and release notes.

## About Me

I'm a bilingual Technical Writer (English/Spanish) focused on strategic documentation for engineering teams. I specialize in translating complex technical decisions into clear, actionable content using docs-as-code workflows and tools like Markdown, YAML, and OpenAPI.

## What's Included

This repository features:

- **API references** defined in OpenAPI [FaceRecognition_RESTAPI.yaml](https://github.com/may-techwriter/Sample_TechnicalDocumentation/blob/main/FaceRecognition_RESTAPI.yaml) and validated with Postman and cURL  
  → You can explore the API interactively by uploading the YAML file to [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io)  
- **Configuration guide** to customize how the system behaves to suit your needs. Click [here]() to open the Configuration Guide.
- **Release notes** with impact analysis across software versions

## Tools & Methods

- Markdown, YAML, OpenAPI

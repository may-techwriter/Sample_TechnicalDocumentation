# Sample_TechnicalDocumentation

This is a sample repository that includes sample documents to show my skills as a Technical Writer.

This is a **fictional REST API** documentation
created as a portfolio sample
for technical writing purposes.

The API allows clients supports CRUD operations (Create, Retreive, Update, Delete) to support the entire lifecycle of the identity. It can connect to relational databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQLServer (MMSQL) PostgreSQL and SQLite.
